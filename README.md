Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Client: The Gaming Room is a game development company.

  Their Goal:  Expand their existing game, "Draw It or Lose It," to reach a broader audience. This involves:

  Cross-Platform Functionality: The game needs to work seamlessly on various platforms including web, desktop systems (Windows, Mac, Linux), and mobile devices (iOS, Android).
  Collaborative Gameplay: They want to foster a sense of community with features like: * Multiple teams competing in real-time * The ability for teams to have multiple players

  Key Considerations:
  The system needs a way to distinguish each game, team, and player to prevent conflicts.
  Only one active instance of a game should exist in memory at any given time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I prioritize well-defined sections, logical flow of information, and clear language. This makes the document easy for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand. The core focus remains on how the software    design fulfills the client's stated requirements. Technical choices are always explained in terms of the benefits they provide to the end-user.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  The design document served as a blueprint. It outlined the system's architecture, and how the various software components should interact. This clear roadmap reduced ambiguity and decision fatigue when developing the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  The requirements section. While functional, it could be more concise and detailed. Rephrasing requirements using "The game shall..." phrasing, and providing more detail into the requirements.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The Gaming Room wanted to bring their game to more players on different devices. I designed the system with this in mind, choosing technologies for cross-platform compatibility and a cloud backend that could handle           growth. Features like unique game names improve the user experience, and I prioritized security to protect player data. Focusing on what the users need is essential for building software that people actually want to use.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I begin by carefully studying the project goals and requirements. Next, I research design patterns and software structures that would be a good fit.  The core data model takes shape as a UML diagram, and I draft potential    system architectures. As I start coding, I continue refining the architecture and the UML to ensure everything aligns. This iterative approach lets me refine all aspects of the design as development progresses. In the        future, I'd prioritize getting more direct user feedback throughout the design process to avoid missing issues that a technical perspective might overlook. I'd also proactively analyze security risks and design in            protection from the start. Learning more design patterns would give me better tools to solve problems efficiently.
